Our one-to-one meeting is heavily inspired in spirit and practice by the [24 questions to ask in your next 1:1 meeting](https://www.small-improvements.com/blog/24-questions-ask-next-11-meeting/) post by Jason Lauristen on _Small improvements_ blog.

HR representative and team leads engaging in one-to-ones with developers are required to read the whole post and take inspiration.

## Scheduling

Three (3) one-to-one meetings are scheduled each year. All employees with a role in operations will attend the meeting with a designated HR representative.  
Each employee must [get ready for the meeting compiling her ISC](/working-at-sparkfabrik/impact-scoring#how-scoring-happens) with her team leader.  
Optionally junior developers ISCs [may be compiled with the help of a senior team mate](/working-at-sparkfabrik/impact-scoring#how-scoring-happens) and their one-to-one conducted by a lead developer.

## Goal

The one-to-one meeting is **not** an occasion for control or top-down education. It is a meeting **of the employee and for the employee**, with the following goals:

* Receive honest feedback
* Provide honest feedback
* Discuss impediments
* Setting near-range goals and check the milestones

## Agenda

To achieve meeting goals we set the following agenda over a 60 minutes meeting:

1. **Warm-up** (5 mins): What is the single most important thing we need to discuss today?
2. **Celebration** (10 mins): What are your most significant accomplishments since we last met? Did you already match the goals you set last time?
3. **Impediments** (15 mins): What obstacles are you encountering right now? Where do you struggle?
4. **Next goals** (15 mins): What are the most important things you will focus on before we meet next (relates to point 1)? Can we state it as a [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goal?
5. **Offer to help** (10 mins): What can we as your managers do better or differently to support you?
6. **Facilitator feedback** (5 mins): What are your feelings on this one-to-one? How should I improve as a facilitator?

## Outcome

The HR representative will summarize the outcome and new goals in a private mail with the employee.  
The outcome of the meeting will be shared by discussion with the company governance, and potentially team leads if applicable.
